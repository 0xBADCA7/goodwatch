These directories contain different hardware revisions of the
GoodWatch.  When a revision is manufactured, its files are copied to a
new directory and the old may only be updated for documentation
reasons.


## GoodWatch30

This is our next design, featuring a new balun and more generous
filters.  It is not yet ready.


## GoodWatch20, 21

These designs are verified and being worn daily.  You probably want to
build one of them, but it doesn't much matter which one.  Either send
the Gerbers to a manufacturer or bug Travis to give you some boards.

## GoodWatch10

This was the first GoodWatch, which lacked a radio and had minor
mechanical misalignments.  You probably don't want this one anymore.
