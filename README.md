Howdy y'all,

This is a side project of mine to build a replacement circuit board
for the Casio CA-53W calculator watch.  As a side project, it has no
warranty whatsoever and you shouldn't use it for anything.

In the rare case that you find this project to be useful, you owe me a
pint of good, hoppy pale ale.  All license to use this project is
revoked if you try to pass off a pilsner instead.
