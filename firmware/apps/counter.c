  \brief Frequency Counter Application

  Howdy y'all,
  
  Once upon a time, a neighbor was in Heidelberg for the Troopers
  conference, and he wanted to join the staff radio networks.  So he
  performed the out-of-band-TX mod to his Kenwood TH-D74, and borrowed
  a laptop and SDR to find the staff simplex frequency.  From an audio
  recording, he identified the squelch tones and was on the air.
  
  But why did he need an SDR, when his wristwatch ought to have been
  able to quickly find the peak during transmission?  This applet
  seeks to remedy that problem by providing a basic frequency counter,
  displaying the center frequency of the strongest signal yet
  observed.  It is loosely based on Michael Ossmann's spectrum
  analyzer, written for the Girltech IMME in 2010.

  This implementation does a wideband sweep from 410 to 470
  MHz when the 0 button is pressed.  The 1 button repeats the broad
  sweep without forgetting the old peak.

  Generally, you will just run these all by pressing 0, but for TDMA
  protocols like DMR/MotoTrbo, it's handy to rerun the scan by
  starting with the 1 button.
  
  The result will be off by up to 100kHz, so just treat the result as
  a decent guess.  Later versions will scan other bands.
  
  Press '=' to copy the frequency to the VLO.
