  \brief Frequency Counter Application

  Howdy y'all,
  
  Once upon a time, a neighbor was in Heidelberg for the Troopers
  conference, and he wanted to join the staff radio networks.  So he
  performed the out-of-band-TX mod to his Kenwood TH-D74, and borrowed
  a laptop and SDR to find the staff simplex frequency.  From an audio
  recording, he identified the squelch tones and was on the air.
  
  But why did he need an SDR, when his wristwatch ought to have been
  able to quickly find the peak during transmission?  This applet
  seeks to remedy that problem by providing a basic frequency counter,
  displaying the center frequency of the strongest signal yet
  observed.  It is loosely based on Michael Ossmann's spectrum
  analyzer, written for the Girltech IMME in 2010.

  This implementation does a single sweep from 410 to 470 MHz when the
  0 button is pressed.  A better implementation would perform a second
  pass with a narrower filter to better identify the center frequency
  after a sweep.
