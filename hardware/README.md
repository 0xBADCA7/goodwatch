These directories contain different hardware revisions of the
GoodWatch.  When a revision is manufactured, its files are copied to a
new directory and the old may only be updated for documentation
reasons.

The GoodWatch 22 and earlier were designed in Kicad 4, and might be
awkward to open in newer revisions.  The GoodWatch30 is designed in
Kicad 5.


## GoodWatch 30

This is our next design, featuring a new balun and more generous
filters.  It is not yet ready.


## GoodWatch 20, 21, 22

These designs are verified and being worn daily.  You probably want to
build one of them, but it doesn't much matter which one.  Either send
the Gerbers to a manufacturer or bug Travis to give you some boards.

## GoodWatch 10

This was the first GoodWatch, which lacked a radio and had minor
mechanical misalignments.  You probably don't want this one anymore.
